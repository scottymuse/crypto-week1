This is a programming assignment for Week 1 of my Crypto class.

All it does is take a bunch of cyphertexts, all encrypted with the same stream cipher key. Anybody dabling in cryptography knows that it is insecure to use the same stream cipher key more than once. This program will analyze the cipher texts and make a pretty good guess as to what the key is. The more ciphertexts the better it will generally work. But the program could probably use some tweeking based on the data you are trying to analyze.

Kind of overkill for the assignment, but it was fun to do nonetheless.
